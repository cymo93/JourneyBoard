# Technical Debt, Known Issues, and Future Improvements

This document outlines the current limitations of the JourneyBoard application and suggests potential areas for future development. It is intended to give a new development agent a transparent overview of the project's state.

## 1. Resolved Major Issues ✅

### **State Management & Data Persistence - RESOLVED**

-   **Previous Issue**: The entire application relied on `localStorage` for data persistence.
-   **Solution Implemented**: 
    -   ✅ **Firebase Authentication**: User authentication system with email/password and Google sign-in.
    -   ✅ **Firebase Firestore**: Cloud database replacing all `localStorage` logic.
    -   ✅ **Real-time Collaboration**: Trip sharing with permission levels (edit/view).
    -   ✅ **Cross-device Access**: Data is now accessible from any device with proper authentication.
    -   ✅ **Production Deployment**: Application is deployed on Vercel with proper environment configuration.

### **Image System & Visual Experience - RESOLVED**

-   **Previous Issue**: Trip cards showed ugly grey placeholders and visual conflicts.
-   **Solution Implemented**:
    -   ✅ **Intelligent Default Image System**: Theme-based fallback images with keyword detection.
    -   ✅ **Pexels API Integration**: Dynamic location banner images with intelligent caching.
    -   ✅ **Robust Error Handling**: Multiple fallback layers ensure images always display.
    -   ✅ **Visual Consistency**: No more overlapping elements or placeholder text conflicts.

### **Pexels API Authentication - RESOLVED**

-   **Previous Issue**: 401 Unauthorized errors due to incorrect API key format.
-   **Solution Implemented**:
    -   ✅ **Proper Bearer Token**: Updated all API calls to use `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` format.
    -   ✅ **Server-side Security**: API keys stored securely and never exposed to client.
    -   ✅ **Diagnostic Tools**: Added "Test Pexels API" button for troubleshooting.

## 2. Current Minor Issues & Optimizations

### **Image System Limitations**

-   **Default Image Variety**: All themes currently use the same fallback image due to simplified implementation.
    -   **Impact**: Reduces visual variety but maintains functionality.
    -   **Improvement Path**: Implement dynamic Pexels fetching for default images with Firestore caching.

-   **Image Caching**: Some images may not cache properly on first load.
    -   **Impact**: Occasional API calls for already-viewed images.
    -   **Improvement Path**: Implement more robust caching strategy with cache invalidation.

### **Performance Optimizations**

-   **Real-time Updates**: Firestore real-time listeners could be optimized for better performance with large datasets.
    -   **Improvement Path**: Implement pagination and selective listening for better scalability.

-   **Image Loading**: While the Pexels integration works well, there could be optimization for image preloading.
    -   **Improvement Path**: Implement image preloading strategies for better perceived performance.

### **User Experience Enhancements**

-   **Mobile Responsiveness**: While the app works on mobile, some interactions could be more touch-friendly.
    -   **Improvement Path**: Enhance mobile-specific interactions and gestures.

-   **Offline Support**: The app currently requires internet connectivity.
    -   **Improvement Path**: Implement offline-first architecture with local caching and sync when online.

## 3. Potential Future Features & Enhancements

### **Image System Enhancements**

-   **Dynamic Default Images**: 
    -   Fetch unique Pexels images for each theme instead of using the same fallback.
    -   Implement intelligent image selection based on trip context.
    -   Add image rotation to prevent repetition.

-   **Advanced Image Features**:
    -   User-uploaded trip photos.
    -   AI-generated trip cover images using Gemini image generation.
    -   Image editing and cropping tools.

### **UX/UI Improvements**

-   **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**:
    -   Allow users to reorder locations on the Trip Timeline page via drag-and-drop.
    -   Allow users to reorder `DateBlock` cards within a location.
    -   Allow users to reorder activity items within a day.

-   **"Suggest Durations" Feature**: The button exists on the Trip Timeline page but has no functionality.
    -   **Improvement Path**: Implement an AI flow that suggests the optimal number of days to spend in each location based on the user's interests and the locations themselves. The flow could update the `dateBlocks` for each location automatically.

-   **Advanced Trip Templates**:
    -   Pre-built trip templates for common destinations.
    -   Template sharing between users.

-   **Trip Analytics**:
    -   Travel statistics and insights.
    -   Budget tracking and expense management.

### **Collaboration Enhancements**

-   **Real-time Chat**: Add in-app messaging for trip collaborators.
-   **Activity Comments**: Allow collaborators to comment on specific activities.
-   **Trip Versioning**: Track changes and allow rollbacks to previous versions.
-   **Bulk Sharing**: Share multiple trips at once with a group.

### **AI Enhancements**

-   **Real-time AI Suggestions**: Instead of clicking a button, the AI could proactively offer suggestions as a user adds activities.
-   **Image Generation**: Use a generative image model (like `gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation`) to create unique cover images for each trip based on its title and locations.
-   **Itinerary Optimization**: Create an AI flow that can review a user's entire plan and suggest optimizations (e.g., "The museum you planned for Tuesday is closed that day, I suggest moving it to Wednesday."). This would require the AI to have access to tools that can check real-world data like opening hours.
-   **Multi-Modal Input**: Allow users to upload a photo of a landmark and have the AI identify it and suggest related activities.
-   **Smart Recommendations**: AI-powered suggestions for restaurants, attractions, and activities based on user preferences and location.

### **Integration Features**

-   **Calendar Integration**: Sync trips with Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or Outlook.
-   **Booking Integrations**: Enhanced integration with booking platforms for flights, hotels, and activities.
-   **Weather Integration**: Real-time weather data for trip planning.
-   **Transportation**: Integration with transportation apps for route planning.

### **Advanced Features**

-   **Trip Export**: Export trips to PDF, Google Docs, or other formats.
-   **Social Features**: Public trip sharing and discovery of popular destinations.
-   **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization for global users.
-   **Accessibility**: Enhanced accessibility features for users with disabilities.

## 4. Technical Improvements

-   **Advanced Permissions**: More granular permission system for trip sharing.
-   **Audit Logging**: Track changes and user actions for security purposes.

### **Image System Technical Debt**

-   **Async Default Images**: The current synchronous implementation was chosen to avoid TypeScript conflicts, but limits functionality.
    -   **Impact**: Cannot dynamically fetch different images for each theme.
    -   **Improvement Path**: Refactor to use proper async patterns with better error handling.

-   **Image Optimization**: Not using Next.js Image optimization features.
    -   **Impact**: Larger image file sizes and slower loading.
    -   **Improvement Path**: Implement proper Next.js Image optimization with responsive sizes.

## 5. Deployment & Infrastructure
