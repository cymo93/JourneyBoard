## 1. High-Level Summary

**JourneyBoard** is a web-based, AI-powered travel planning application that transforms how users plan and organize their trips. It allows users to create multi-location trip itineraries, visualize them on a timeline, and receive intelligent suggestions for activities. The core experience is designed to be highly visual, interactive, and intuitive, leveraging AI to reduce the cognitive load of travel planning.

The application is built as a single-page application (SPA) using a modern web stack with cloud-based data persistence and user authentication. It features a sophisticated image system that provides beautiful, contextually relevant visuals for trips and locations, with intelligent fallbacks and dynamic content fetching.

## 2. Target Audience

The primary users are individuals or small groups planning personal or leisure trips. They value a simple, clean interface and appreciate smart features that help them organize their thoughts and discover new activities. The app supports collaborative trip planning, allowing users to share trips with friends and family, making it perfect for group travel coordination.

## 3. Core Purpose & Vision

The vision for JourneyBoard is to be more than just a note-taking app for travel. It aims to be an intelligent travel partner that understands the context of a user's entire trip to provide relevant, timely, and personalized suggestions. It prioritizes a seamless user experience where planning feels less like a chore and more like part of the adventure itself. The app now supports real-time collaboration, making it perfect for group travel planning.
